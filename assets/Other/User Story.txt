As a gamer a would like to find games I would enjoy playing by description, genre on recommendations based on games I already like. And the application should provide me the best deals for those games.

 genre, platform for PC - selection (recommended >50%) passing list of names pass to Cheapshark

User enters game title

app generates a list of buttons with results of a query

user presses a button of a list of games provided

App generates 1) game description
		2) list of deals for this game
		3) adds 1 record to history
