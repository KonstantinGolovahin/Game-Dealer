As a gamer a would like to find games I would enjoy playing by description, genre on recommendations based on games I already like. And the application should provide me the best deals for those games.

 genre, platform for PC - selection (recommended >50%) passing list of names pass to Cheapshark

User enters genre

User enters platform (default one = PC)

ApI call returmes a list of games (up to 10)

when user clicks on a game title this will be passed to CheapShark API to generate a list of deals and games details are being populated somewhere (1 more call)

List of deals will be displayed to a user as a table
